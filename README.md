pandas is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to work both with relational or labeled data. It is a fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real world data analysis in Python, well suited for tabular data with heterogeneously-typed columns, ordered and unordered series data, arbitrary matrix data (homogeneously typed or heterogeneous) with row and column labels, and any other form of observational / statistical data sets.
We will overview the main features of this package with a few scientific examples.
